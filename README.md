## Write a story one line at a time...
This is the first line of our story that Jack has written
about how someones life got flipped-turned upside down.
He was a troubled young man.
West Philadelphia born and raised.
Sometimes he would find a good bar to hang out in
but nobody ever wanted to sit with him.
On the playground was where he spent most of his days.
But the police removed him for inappropriate behaviour.
That monster jack... littered!
Making trouble in my neighborhood!
If he carries on like this he's gunna get an ASBO.
His parents have now disowned him.
He got in one little fight and my mom got scared.
She was always worried about him, you can clearly see why.
Then one day he found his new family, Scott Logic!
